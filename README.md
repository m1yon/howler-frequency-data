npm install use-howler-frequency-data
```

## üéì Usage/Examples

```tsx
import { Howl } from 'howler'
import { useHowlerFrequencyData } from 'use-howler-frequency-data'

const App = () => {
  const frequencyData = useHowlerFrequencyData({
    howls: [
      new Howl({
        src: ['audio/audio-sample1.mp3'],
      }),
      new Howl({
        src: ['audio/audio-sample2.mp3'],
      }),
    ],
  })

  // frequency data for audio-sample1.mp3 (updates real-time once audio is played)
  // frequencyData[0] = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0....]

  // frequency data for audio-sample2.mp3 (updates real-time once audio is played)
  // frequencyData[1] = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0....]

  // throw in some logic to write frequencyData to your canvas element

  return <canvas />
}

## üîä Demo

A sample project can be found inside the repo under `/example`. It's a simple audio visualizer utilizing use-howler-frequency-data in combination with the canvas API.
